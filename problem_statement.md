## End hour blunder

Leo was given the task to create a simple web api to serve "Product" details to the users. He was hired on the basis that he is an awesome coder and can create APIs within few hours without any mistake. His over confidence made him totally forgot that his manager specifically asked him to "validate" everything and serve the right kind of "status codes", before the APIs can be used by the end users.

He created the APIs in a hurry and have written some tests.But, before he could test everything, he remembers it is his mother's birthday and he has to go home early but he has to test and merge his code by the end of today.

Before he leaves, he gives you a few pointers :
- Changes are only needed in `ProductController`, I have completed the rest of the code
- It has 5 endpoints
    - Get, GetAll, Post, Put, Delete
- Don't worry about the 'GetAll', it's working
- I forgot to validate the input
- I forgot to return the right action results

Can you help your friend Leo by adding the necessary code blocks to complete his APIs by the end of the day?
